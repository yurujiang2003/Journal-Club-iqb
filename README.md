# List of papers on cancer immunology and ML_protein
>this repository is inspired by [Kevin Kaichuang Yang](https://github.com/yangkky) and [Sean Peldom Zhang](https://github.com/Peldom). Their works [Machine-learning-for-proteins](https://github.com/yangkky/Machine-learning-for-proteins) and [papers_for_protein_design_using_DL](https://github.com/Peldom/papers_for_protein_design_using_DL) are so unparalleled that I can't help but to follow their steps. I establish the repository mainly for systematically organize these papers read by iqb members, so that anyone interested in cancer immunology and machine learning for protein can learn about the latest achievement in the field thorough the papers. I will try my best to keep this repository updated. <br>

>Any contributions and suggestions are welcome!<br>

>**Note**: The papers are sorted by their themes and the time they are published.
